Finally, my programming skills made a new page for our blog: ["my plantmap"](http://www.latinamerica.bike//plantmap).

The page represents work in progress and I hope to get the layout more convinient soon as well as to implement more planr information.

The page shows some of the plants I found on our way while cycling or hiking. 

Enjoy the flora of South America.
