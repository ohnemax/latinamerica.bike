 Crazy day! First we leave the park, then a very strong tail wind pushes us to the chilean-argentinian border and a little further. But then the road made a turn - the side winds now even blew us away while pushing the bike. Shortly before the end of this part a truck driver offered a lift and brought us to Esperanza.
