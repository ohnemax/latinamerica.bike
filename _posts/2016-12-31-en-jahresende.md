Eventually, the year ends. Many things happened, and we gained many new experiences. We both got a certificate with a new title and started a great journey.

At the same time, the year brought a lot of right wing and populist bullshit. No one/only few expected that, and even less really know what to do. Also we are here in latinamerica, it doesn't let us sleep quietly. Surely, we will come back and try to do our share to improve things.

In the next year, we will ascend. Not only on the imperialistic map towards north, but also in the sense of gaining height in the Andes. (Remark: In German, ascending "aufwärts gehen" means both "climbing a hill" as well as "things will get better"...)

**We wish you all the best for the new year and "feliz año nuevo".**
