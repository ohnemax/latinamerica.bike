It took a couple of days longer than expected, but our blog is online now. Happy reading!

There are already some posts, even before this entry. Several things have happened. Until now, there is no commentary funtion, but we happily look forward to friendly, encouraging emails or other messages. You can reach us for example by writing a message to martha@latin...a.bike and moritz@latin...a.bike Please replace the three dots by yourself.

The blog is bilingual, however most we might not be able to translate every single entry to both languages - so the majority will be German, but there should be frequent english updates.
