 Finally, we reach Paso Sico, afterwards the argentinian/chilean border station. The following road is really bad and sandy, but we keep going. We find a nice trailer at a construction site to sleep in. But after dinner, the night guard comes and wants to sleep inside. The guys that brought him take us to the next town, were we find a spot to put the tent.
