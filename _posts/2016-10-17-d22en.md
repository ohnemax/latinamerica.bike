 Very short trip today. We cycled from Tornquist to the park entrace of the "Parque Provincial Ernesto Tornquist." While we climbed 300m of height, we only made slightly more than 20km in total. To get some exercise, we made a short round trip to the second park entrance in the afternoon - 10 more kilometers and 30 minutes of hiking.
