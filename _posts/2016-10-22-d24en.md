 Originally we had a very different place in mind to spend the night. But we decided to continue cycling after the first hours. Eventually we reached Treniente Origone, a very small village in the middle of nowhere. We asked for a place to put our tent and got offered a very nice one: the main square of the village. It even offered a shower, a parilla and some tables. Very nice!
