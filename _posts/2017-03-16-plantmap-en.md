Finally, my page made it online before we continue cycling: [my plantmap](http://www.latinamerica.bike//plantmap). 

The layout still wants some improvement, but as it is work in progress it hopefully gets better.

This page represents a solution for all the plant pictures I take on the way. 

Enjoy the Souh America Flora.
