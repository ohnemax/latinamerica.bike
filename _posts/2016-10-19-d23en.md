 First time we go the same road back that we came - from "Parque Provincial Ernesto Tornquist" back to Bah√≠a Blanca. Nearly 100km in total. The first 20km were perfect cycling conditions - medium wind from behind plus soft descend. We made them quickly, in much less than an hour. The other 80km were more demanding - wind from sideways, plus a busy road with many trucks.
